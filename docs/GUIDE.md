# Overview

## Compiling and Running

### Common Extensions and GHC options

You generally want to adhere to the same extensions and GHC options the [Plutarch repo](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/blob/master/plutarch.cabal) uses.

### Code

You can compile a Plutarch term using `compile`(from `Plutarch` module), making sure it has no free variables. `compile` returns a `Script`- you can use this as you would any other Plutus script. The API in `Plutus.V1.Ledger.Scripts` should prove helpful.

For further insight into what is compiled - you can use `printTerm` or `printScript` (from `Plutarch` module).

I often use these helper functions to test Plutarch quickly-

```haskell
import Data.Text (Text)
import Plutarch.Evaluate (evaluateScript)
import Plutarch (ClosedTerm, compile)
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Api (ExBudget)
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Scripts (Script (unScript), ScriptError, applyArguments)
import UntypedPlutusCore (DeBruijn, DefaultFun, DefaultUni, Program)
import PlutusTx (Data)

eval :: ClosedTerm a -> Either ScriptError (ExBudget, [Text], Program DeBruijn DefaultUni DefaultFun ())
eval x = fmap (\(a, b, s) -> (a, b, unScript s)) . evaluateScript $ compile x

evalWithArgs :: ClosedTerm a -> [Data] -> Either ScriptError (ExBudget, [Text], Program DeBruijn DefaultUni DefaultFun ())
evalWithArgs x args = fmap (\(a, b, s) -> (a, b, unScript s)) . evaluateScript . flip applyArguments args $ compile x
```

The fields in the result triple correspond to execution budget (how much memory and CPU units were used), trace log, and script result - respectively. Often you're only interested in the script result, in that case you can use-

```haskell
evalT :: ClosedTerm a -> Either ScriptError (Program DeBruijn DefaultUni DefaultFun ())
evalT x = fmap (\(_, _, s) -> unScript s) . evaluateScript $ compile x

evalWithArgsT :: ClosedTerm a -> [Data] -> Either ScriptError (Program DeBruijn DefaultUni DefaultFun ())
evalWithArgsT x args = fmap (\(_, _, s) -> unScript s) . evaluateScript . flip applyArguments args $ compile x
```

> Note: You can pretty much ignore the UPLC types involved here. All it really means is that the result is a "UPLC program". When it's printed, it's pretty legible - especially for debugging purposes. Although not necessary to use Plutarch, you may find the [Plutonomicon UPLC guide](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/uplc.md) useful.

## Syntax

A Plutarch script is a `Term`. This can consist of-

### Constants

These can be built directly from Haskell synonyms using `pconstant` (requires [`PConstant`/`PLift`](#pconstant--plift) instance). `pconstant` always takes in a regular Haskell value to create its Plutarch synonym.
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

-- | A plutarch level boolean. Its value is "True", in this case.
x :: Term s PBool
x = pconstant True
```

Or from Plutarch terms within other constructors using `pcon` (requires [`PlutusType`/`PCon`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch) instance)-
```haskell
import Plutarch.Prelude

-- | Create a plutarch level optional value from given value.
f :: Term s (a :--> PMaybe a)
f = plam $ \x -> pcon $ PJust x
-- Note that 'PMaybe' has a 'PlutusType' instance.
```
> `PMaybe` declaration: `data PMaybe a s = PJust (Term s a) | PNothing`

> Aside: Notice that `pcon` actually takes in a Plutarch type to create a Plutarch term.
>
> In particular, `PJust x`, where `x :: Term s a`, has type `PMaybe a s`.
>
> ```hs
> -- Example
> > :t x
> Term s PInteger
> > :t PJust x
> PMaybe PInteger s
> > :t pcon (PJust x)
> Term s (PMaybe PInteger)
> ```
>
> Thus, within the `f` definition above, `pcon` has type `PMaybe a s -> Term s (PMaybe a)`. Similarly, `pcon PNothing` would yield `forall x. Term s (PMaybe x)`, since `PNothing` has type `PMaybe x s`.
>
> ```hs
> -- Example
> > :t PNothing
> PMaybe a s
> > :t pcon PNothing
> Term s (PMaybe a)
> ```

Or by using literals-
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude

-- | A plutarch level integer. Its value is 1, in this case.
x :: Term s PInteger
x = 1

-- | A plutarch level string (this is actually 'Text'). Its value is "foobar", in this case.
y :: Term s PString
y = "foobar"
```

Or by using other, miscellaneous functions provided by Plutarch-
```haskell
import qualified Data.ByteString as BS
import Plutarch.Prelude

-- | A plutarch level bytestring. Its value is [65], in this case.
x :: Term s PByteString
x = phexByteStr "41"
-- ^ 'phexByteStr' interprets a hex string as a bytestring. 0x41 is 65 - of course.
```

### Lambdas
You can create Plutarch level lambdas by apply `plam` over a Haskell level lambda/function.

```haskell
pid :: Term s (a :--> a)
pid = plam $ \x -> x
```

The identity function! Notice the type. A Plutarch level lambda uses the funny arrows `:-->` to encode a function type. In the above case, `pid` is a Plutarch level function that takes a type `a`, and returns the same type - `a`. As one would expect, `:-->` is right associative and things curry like a charm (at least, they should).

Guess what this Plutarch level function does-

```haskell
f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PString :--> a :--> a)
```

That's right! It takes in an integer, a string, and a type `a` and returns the same type `a`. Notice that all of those types are Plutarch level types.

This is the type of the Haskell level function, `plam`-

```haskell
plam :: (Term s a -> Term s b) -> Term s (a :--> b)
```

(That's actually a lie! But we are going to ignore the _real_  `plam` type for simplicity)

It just converts a Haskell level function, which operates on purely Plutarch terms, into a Plutarch level function.

This means that when faced with filling out the gap-

```haskell
f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PString :--> a :--> a)
f = plam $ \???
```

You know that the argument to `plam` here will just be a Haskell function that takes in - `Term s PInteger`, `Term s PString`, and `Term s a` (in  that order), and spits out a `Term s a` back.

### Delayed terms and Forcing
You can use `pdelay` to create a delayed term and `pforce` to force on it. More details at [Delay and Force](#delay-and-force).

## Usage

### Applying functions

You can apply Plutarch level functions using `#` and `#$` (or `papp`). Notice the associativity and precedence of those operators-

```haskell
infixl 8 #

infixr 0 #$
```

`#$` is pretty much just `$` for Plutarch functions. But `#` is left associative and has a high precedence. This essentially means that the following-

```haskell
f # 1 # 2

-- f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger :--> PUnit)
```

applies `f` to 1 and 2. i.e, it is parsed as - `((f 1) 2)`

Whereas, the following-

```haskell
f #$ foo # 1

-- f :: Term s (PBool :--> PUnit)
-- foo :: Term s (PInteger :--> PBool)
```

parses as - `f (foo 1)`

(don't take the parens literally - after all `f` and `foo` are not Haskell level functions)

> Aside: Remember that function application here is **strict**. The arguments _will be evaluated_ and then passed in.
>
> Rule of thumb: If you see `#` - you can quickly infer that a Plutarch level function is being applied and the arguments will be evaluated. Haskell level functions still have their usual semantics, which is why `pif` doesn't evaluate both branches. (if you want, you can use `pif'` - which is a Plutarch level function and therefore strict)

### Conditionals

You can simulate `if/then/else` at the Plutarch level using `pif`-

```haskell
pif :: Term s PBool -> Term s a -> Term s a -> Term s a
```

This has similar semantics to Haskell's `if/then/else`. That is, only the branch for which the predicate holds - is evaluated.

```haskell
pif (pconstant True) 1 2
```

The above evaluates to `1`, which has type `Term s PInteger`

Of course, the predicate can be an arbitrary `Term s PBool` producing computation.

### Recursion

To emulate recursion in UPLC (Untyped Plutus Core), you need to use the Y combinator. Plutarch provides the Y combinator with the name `pfix`-

```haskell
pfix :: Term s (((a :--> b) :--> a :--> b) :--> a :--> b)
```

It works as you would expect, though the type is scary. Think of it as the Haskell type-

```haskell
fix :: ((a -> b) -> (a -> b)) -> a -> b
```

The first argument is &quot;self&quot;, or the function you want to recurse with.

```haskell
import Plutarch.Prelude

pfac :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger)
pfac = pfix #$ plam f
  where
    f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger) -> Term s PInteger -> Term s PInteger
    f self n = pif (n #== 1) n $ n * (self #$ n - 1)
-- (ignore the existence of non positives :D)
```

There's a Plutarch level factorial function! Note how `f` takes in a `self` and just recurses on it. All you have to do, is create a Plutarch level function by using `plam` on `f` and `pfix` the result - and that `self` argument will be taken care of for you.

### Do syntax with `QualifiedDo` and `Plutarch.Monadic`
The `Plutarch.Monadic` module provides convenient do syntax on common usage scenarios. It requires the `QualifiedDo` extension, which is only available in GHC 9.

```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}

import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P
import Plutarch.Prelude

f :: Term s (PScriptPurpose :--> PUnit)
f = plam $ \x -> P.do
  PSpending _ <- pmatch x
  ptrace "matched spending script purpose"
  pconstant ()
```
In essence, `P.do { x; y }` simply translates to `x y`; where `x :: a -> Term s b` and `y :: a`.

Similarly, `P.do { y <- x; z }` translates to `x $ \case { y -> z; _ -> ptraceError <msg> }`; where `x :: (a -> Term s b) -> Term s b`, `y :: a`, and `z :: Term s b`. Of course, if `y` is a fully exhaustive pattern match (e.g, singular constructor), the extra `_ -> ptraceError <msg>` case will not be generated at all and you'd simply get `x $ \y -> z`.

Finally, `P.do { x }` is just `x`.

These semantics make it *extremely* convenient for usage with [`pmatch`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch), [`plet`](#plet-to-avoid-work-duplication), [`pletFields`](#all-about-extracting-fields), and [`ptrace`](#tracing) etc.
```hs
pmatch :: Term s a -> (a s -> Term s b) -> Term s b

ptrace :: Term s PString -> Term s a -> Term s a
```

Of course, as long as the semantics of the `do` notation allows it, you can make your own utility functions that take in continuations - and they can utilize `do` syntax just the same.

#### Translating `do` syntax with `QualifiedDo` to GHC 8
For convenience, most examples in this guide will be utilizing this `do` syntax. However, since `QualifiedDo` is available pre GHC 9 - we'll discuss how to translate those examples to GHC 8.

There are several ways to do this-
* Use [`TermCont`](#do-syntax-with-termcont).
* Don't use do syntax at all. You can easily translate the `do` syntax to regular continuation chains.

  Here's how you'd translate the above `f` function-

  ```hs
  f :: Term s (PScriptPurpose :--> PUnit)
  f = plam $ \x -> pmatch x $ \case
    PSpending _ -> ptrace "matched spending script purpose" $ pconstant ()
    _ -> ptraceError "incorrect script purpose"
  ```
  Simply put, functions like `pmatch`, `pletFields` take in a continuation. The `do` syntax enables you to bind the argument of the continuation using `<-`, and simply use flat code, rather than nested function calls.
* Use the `Cont` monad. You can utilize this to also use regular `do` syntax by simply applying `cont` over functions such as `pmatch`, `pletFields` and similar utilities that take in a continuation function. There is an example of this [here](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/blob/6b7dd254e4aaf366eb716dd3e18788426b3d1e2a/examples/Examples/Api.hs#L175-L189). Notice how `checkSignatory` has been translated to `Cont` monad usage in `checkSignatoryCont`.

  Here's how you'd translate the above `f` function-
  ```hs
  import Control.Monad.Trans.Cont (cont, runCont)

  import Plutarch.Prelude
  import Plutarch.Api.Contexts

  f :: Term s (PScriptPurpose :--> PUnit)
  f = plam $ \x -> (`runCont` id) $ do
    purpose <- cont $ pmatch x
    pure $ case purpose of
      PSpending _ -> ptrace "matched spending script purpose" $ pconstant ()
      _ -> ptraceError "invalid script purpose"
  ```

  Note that you have to translate the pattern matching manually, as `Cont` doesn't have a `MonadFail` instance.
* Use [`RebindableSyntax`](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/rebindable_syntax.html). You can replace the `>>=`, `>>`, and `fail` functions in your scope with the ones from `Plutarch.Monadic` using `RebindableSyntax`. This is arguably a bad practice but the choice is there. This will let you use the `do` syntax word for word. Although you wouldn't be qualifying your `do` keyword (like `P.do`), you'd just be using `do`.

  Here's how you'd translate the above `f` function-
  ```hs
  {-# LANGUAGE RebindableSyntax #-}

  import Prelude hiding ((>>=), (>>), fail)

  import Plutarch.Prelude
  import Plutarch.Monadic ((>>=), (>>), fail)
  import Plutarch.Api.Contexts

  f :: Term s (PScriptPurpose :--> PUnit)
  f = plam $ \x -> do
    PSpending _ <- pmatch x
    ptrace "matched spending script purpose"
    pconstant ()
  ```

### Do syntax with `TermCont`
You can mostly replicate the `do` syntax from `Plutarch.Monadic` using `TermCont`. In particular, the continuation accepting functions like `plet`, `pletFields`, `pmatch` and so on can utilize regular `do` syntax with `TermCont` as the underlying monad.

`TermCont @b s a` essentially represents `(a -> Term s b) -> Term s b`. `a` being the input to the continuation, and `Term s b` being the output. Notice the type application - `b` must have been brought into scope through another binding first.

Here's how you'd write the [above example](#do-syntax-with-qualifieddo-and-plutarchmonadic) with `TermCont` instead.
```hs
import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import Plutarch.Prelude

f :: Term s (PScriptPurpose :--> PUnit)
f = plam $ \x -> unTermCont $ do
  PSpending _ <- tcont $ pmatch x
  pure $ ptrace "matched spending script purpose" $ pconstant ()
```

The best part is that this doesn't require `QualifiedDo`! So you don't need GHC 9.

Furthermore, this is very similar to the `Cont` monad - it just operates on Plutarch level terms. This means you can draw parallels to utilities and patterns one would use when utilizing the `Cont` monad. Here's an example-
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

-- | Terminate with given value on empty list, otherwise continue with head and tail.
nonEmpty :: Term s r -> PList a s -> TermCont @r s (Term s a, Term s (PList a))
nonEmpty x0 list = TermCont $ \k ->
  case list of
    PSCons x xs -> k (x, xs)
    PSNil -> x0

foo :: Term s (PList PInteger :--> PInteger)
foo = plam $ \l -> unTermCont $ do
  (x, xs) <- nonEmpty 0 =<< tcont (pmatch l)
  pure $ x + plength # xs
```
`foo` adds up the first element of the given list with the length of its tail. Unless the list was empty, in which case, it just returns 0. It uses continuations with the `do` syntax to elegantly utilize short circuiting!

### Deriving typeclasses for `newtype`s
If you're defining a `newtype` to an existing Plutarch type, like so-
```hs
newtype PPubKeyHash (s :: S) = PPubKeyHash (Term s PByteString)
```
You ideally want to just have this `newtype` be represetned as a `PByteString` under the hood. Therefore, all the typeclass instances of `PByteString` make sense for `PPubKeyHash` as well. In this case, you can simply derive all those typeclasses for your `PPubKeyHash` type as well! Via `DerivePNewtype`-
```hs
newtype PPubKeyHash (s :: S) = PPubKeyHash (Term s PByteString)
  deriving (PlutusType, PIsData, PEq, POrd) via (DerivePNewtype PPubKeyHash PByteString)
```
`DerivePNewtype` takes two type parameters. Both of them are Plutarch types (i.e types with kind `PType`). The first one is the type you're deriving the instances for, while the second one is the *inner* type (whatever `PPubKeyHash` is a newtype to).

> Note: It's important to note that the contents of a `newtype` *that aims to be a Plutarch type* (i.e can be represented as a Plutarch term), must also be Plutarch terms. The type `PByteString s` simply doesn't exist in the Plutus Core world after compilation. It's all just `Term`s. So, when you say `Term s PPubKeyHash`, you're really just describing a `Term s PByteString` under the hood - since that's what it *is* during runtime.

> Aside: You can access the inner type using `pto` (assuming it's a `PlutusType` instance). For example, `pto x`, where `x :: Term s PPubKeyHash`, would give you `Term s PByteString`. `pto` converts a [`PlutusType`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch) term to its inner type. This is very useful, for example, when you need to use a function that operates on bytestring terms, but all you have is a `Term s PPubKeyHash`. You *know* it's literally a bytestring under the hood anyway - but how do you obtain that? Using `pto`!

Currently, `DerivePNewtype` lets you derive the following typeclasses for your Plutarch *types*:-
* `PlutusType`
* `PIsData`
* `PEq`
* `POrd`
* `PIntegral`

You can also derive the following typeclasses for Plutarch *terms*:-
* `Num`
* `Semigroup`
* `Monoid`

What does this mean? Well, `Num` would actually be implemented for `Term s a`, where `a` is a Plutarch type. For example, if you wanted to implement `Semigroup` for `Term s PPubKeyHash` (`Term s PByteString` already has a `Semigroup` instance), you can write-
```hs
{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}

deriving via (Term s (DerivePNewtype PPubKeyHash PByteString)) instance Semigroup (Term s PPubKeyHash)
```

### Deriving typeclasses with generics
Plutarch also provides sophisticated generic deriving support for completely custom types. In particular, you can easily derive `PlutusType` for your own type-
```hs
import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP
import Plutarch.Prelude

data MyType (a :: PType) (b :: PType) (s :: S)
  = One (Term s a)
  | Two (Term s b)
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic, PlutusType)
```
> Note: This requires the `generics-sop` package.

This will use a [scott encoding representation](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding) for `MyType`, which is typically what you want. However, this will forbid you from representing your type as a `Data` value and as a result - you cannot implement `PIsData` for it. (Well, you can if you try hard enough - but you *really really really* shouldn't)

Currently, generic deriving supports the following typeclasses:-
* [`PlutusType`](#implementing-plutustype-for-your-own-types) (scott encoding only)
* [`PIsDataRepr`](#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends)

## Concepts

### Hoisting, metaprogramming,  and fundamentals

What is essentially happening here, is that we have a 2-stage compilation process.

First GHC compiles our code, then our code generates an _AST_ of our Plutus script,

which is then serialized using `compile`.

The important thing to note, is that when you have a definition like:

```haskell
x :: Term s PInteger
x = something complex
```

Any use of `x` will inline the **full definition** of `x`. `x + x` will duplicate `something complex` in the AST. To avoid this, you should [use `plet` in order to avoid duplicate work](#plet-to-avoid-work-duplication). Do note that this is **strictly evaluated, and hence isn't always the best solution.**

There is however still a problem: What about top-level functions, like `fib`, `sum`, `filter`, and such? We can use `plet` to avoid duplicating the definition, but this error-prone, since to do this perfectly each function that generates part of the AST would need to have access to the `plet`'ed definitions, meaning that we'd likely have to put it into a record or typeclass.

To solve this problem, Plutarch supports _hoisting_. Hoisting only works for _closed terms_, that is, terms that don't reference any free variables (introduced by `plam`).

Hoisted terms are essentially moved to a top-level `plet`, i.e. it's essentially common subexpression elimination. Do note that because of this, your hoisted term is **also strictly evaluated, meaning that you shouldn't hoist non-lazy complex computations (use e.g.** `pdelay` **to avoid this).**

#### Hoisting Operators
For the sake of convenience, you often would want to use operators - which must be Haskell level functions. This is the case for `+`, `-`, `#==` and many more.

Choosing convenience over efficiency is difficult, but if you notice that your operator uses complex logic and may end up creating big terms - you can trivially factor out the logic into a Plutarch level function, hoist it, and simply apply that function within the operator.

Consider boolean or-
```hs
(#||) :: Term s PBool -> Term s PBool -> Term s PBool
x #|| y = pif x (pconstant PTrue) $ pif y (pconstant PTrue) $ pconstant PFalse
```
You can factor out most of the logic to a Plutarch level function, and apply that in the operator definition-

```hs
(#||) :: Term s PBool -> Term s PBool -> Term s PBool
x #|| y = por # x # pdelay y

por :: Term s (PBool :--> PDelayed PBool :--> PBool)
por = phoistAcyclic $ plam $ \x y -> pif' # x # pconstant PTrue # pforce y
```

In general the pattern goes like this-
```hs
(<//>) :: Term s x -> Term s y -> Term s z
x <//> y = f # x # y

f :: Term s (x :--> y :--> z)
f = phoistAcyclic $ plam $ \x y -> <complex computation>
```
(OR, simply inlined)
```hs
(<//>) :: Term s x -> Term s y -> Term s z
x <//> y = (\f -> f # x # y) $ phoistAcyclic $ plam $ \x y -> <complex computation>
```

> Note: You don't even need to export the Plutarch level function or anything! You can simply have that complex logic factored out into a *hoisted, internal Plutarch function* and everything will work just fine!

### What is the `s`?

The `s` essentially represents the context, and is like the `s` of `ST`.

It's used to distinguish between closed and open terms:

- Closed term: `type ClosedTerm = forall s. Term s a`
- Arbitrary term: `exists s. Term s a`
- NB: `(exists s. Term s a) -> b` is isomorphic to
- `forall s. Term s a → b`

### eDSL Types in Plutarch

Most types prefixed with `P` are eDSL-level types, meaning that they're meant to be used with `Term`. They are merely used as a tag, and what Haskell value they can hold is not important. Their kind must be `PType`.

### `plet` to avoid work duplication
Sometimes, when writing Haskell level functions for generating Plutarch terms, you may find yourself needing to re-use the Haskell level function's argument multiple times-
```hs
foo :: Term s PString -> Term s PString
foo x = x <> x
```
This is *really* bad if `x` is actually represented by a big unevaluated computation yielding `Term s PString`. Whenever you find yourself using a Haskell level function argument multiple times - you may want to *strictly* evaluate it first. `plet` lets you do just that-
```hs
foo :: Term s PString -> Term s PString
foo x' = plet x' $ \x -> x <> x
```

Also see: [Don't duplicate work](#dont-duplicate-work).

### Tracing
You can use the functions `ptrace`, `ptraceError`, `ptraceIfFalse`, `ptraceIfTrue` (from `Plutarch.Trace`) for tracing. These behave similarly to the ones you're used to from [PlutusTx](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Trace.html).

If you have the `development` flag for `plutarch` turned on - you'll see the trace messages appear in the trace log during script evaluation. When not in development mode - these functions basically do nothing.

### Raising errors
In Plutus Tx, you'd signal validation failure with the [`error`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Prelude.html#v:error) function. You can do the same in Plutarch using `perror`.
```hs
fails :: Term s (PData :--> PData :--> PData :--> PUnit)
fails = plam $ \_ _ _ -> perror
```

### Delay and Force
Use `pdelay` on a term to create a "delayed term".
```hs
let f = plam (\x -> x) in pdelay (f # phexByteStr 0x41)
```
Compiling and evaluating it yields-
```
Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Delay () (Constant () (Some (ValueOf bytestring "A"))))
```
The function application is "delayed". It will not be evaluated (and therefore computed) until it is *forced*.

Plutarch level function application is strict. All of your function arguments are evaluated **before** the function is called.

This is often undesirable, and you want to create a delayed term instead that you want to force *only* when you need to compute it.

You can force a previously delayed expression using pforce-
```hs
pforce $ let f = plam (\x -> x) in pdelay (f # phexByteStr "41")
```
It evaluates to-
```
Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf bytestring "A")))
```

Delaying the argument to a Plutarch level function, within the function body, is not very useful - since the argument has been evaluated before the function body has been entered! Instead, you'll often notice usage of `pdelay` and `pforce` in Haskell level function arguments to simulate laziness-
```hs
pif' :: Term s (PBool :--> a :--> a :--> a)

-- | Lazy if-then-else.
pif :: Term s PBool -> Term s a -> Term s a -> Term s a
pif cond whenTrue whenFalse = pforce $ pif' # cond # pdelay whenTrue # pdelay whenFalse
```

`pif'` is a direct synonym to the `IfThenElse` Plutus Core builtin function. Of course, it evaluates its arguments strictly but you often want an if-then-else that doesn't evaluate both its branches - only the one for which the condition holds. So, `pif`, as a haskell level function can take in both branches (without any concept of evaluating them), delay them and *then* apply it to `pif'`. Finally, a `pforce` will force the yielded branch that was previously delayed.

Delay and Force will be one of your most useful tools while writing Plutarch. Make sure you get a grip on them!

### Data encoding and Scott encoding
In Plutus Core, there are really two (conflicting) ways to represent non-trivial ADTs- `Constr` data encoding, or Scott encoding. You can (you should!) only use one of these representations for your non-trivial types.

> Aside: What's a "trivial" type? The non-data builtin types! `PInteger`, `PByteString`, `PBuiltinList`, `PBuiltinPair`, and `PMap` (actually just a builtin list of builtin pairs).

`Constr` data is essentially a sum-of-products representation. However, it can only contain other `Data` values (not necessarily just `Constr` data, could be `I` data, `B` data etc.) as its fields. Plutus Core famously lacks the ability to represent functions using this encoding, and thus - `Constr` encoded values simply cannot contain functions.

> Note: You can find out more about the deep details of `Data`/`BuiltinData` at [plutonomicon](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md).

With that said, `Data` encoding is *ubiquitous* on the chain. It's the encoding used by the ledger api types, it's the type of the arguments that can be passed to a script on the chain etc. As a result, your datum and redeemers *must* use data encoding.

On the opposite (and conflicting) end, is scott encoding. [The internet](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/compiler/scott.html) can explain scott encoding way better than I can. But I'll be demonstrating scott encoding with an example anyway.

Firstly, what good is scott encoding? Well it doesn't share the limitation of not being able to contain functions! However, you cannot use scott encoded types within, for example, your datums and redeemers.

Briefly, scott encoding is a way to represent data with functions. The scott encoded representation of `Maybe a` would be-
```hs
(a -> b) -> b -> b
```
`Just 42`, for example, would be represented as this function-
```hs
\f _ -> f 42
```
Whereas `Nothing` would be represented as this function-
```hs
\_ n -> n
```

We covered construction. What about usage/deconstruction? That's also just as simple. Let's say you have a function, `foo :: Maybe Integer -> Integer`, it takes in a scott encoded `Maybe Integer`, adds `42` to its `Just` value. If it's `Nothing`, it just returns 0.
```hs
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

type Maybe a = forall b. (a -> b) -> b -> b

just :: a -> Maybe a
just x = \f _ -> f x

nothing :: Maybe a
nothing = \_ n -> n

foo :: Maybe a ->
foo mb = mb (\x -> x + 42) 0
```
How does that work? Recall that `mb` is really just a function. Here's what the application of `f` would work like-
```hs
foo (just 1)
foo (\f _ -> f 1)
(\f _ -> f 1) (\x -> x + 42) 0
(\x -> x + 42) 1
43
```
```hs
foo nothing
foo (\_ n -> n)
(\_ n -> n) (\x -> x + 42) 0
0
```
How cool is that?

This is the same recipe followed in the implementation of `PMaybe`. See its [PlutusType impl](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch) below!

### Unsafe functions
There are internal functions such as `punsafeCoerce`, `punsafeConstant` etc. that give you terms without their specific type. These **should not** be used by Plutarch users. It is the duty of the user of these unsafe functions to get the type right - and it is very easy to get the type wrong. You can easily make the type system believe you're creating a `Term s PInteger`, when in reality, you created a function.

Things will go very wrong during script evaluation if you do that kind of thing.

The good thing is that unsafe functions all have explicit indicators through the names, as long as you don't use any `punsafe*` functions - you should be fine!

## Typeclasses

### Equality and Order

Plutarch level equality is provided by the `PEq` typeclass-

```haskell
class PEq t where
  (#==) :: Term s t -> Term s t -> Term s PBool
```

`PInteger` implements `PEq` as you would expect. So you could do-

```haskell
1 #== 2
```

That would yield a `Term s PBool`, which you would probably use with `pif` (or similar)

There is also a synonym to  `Ord`, `POrd`-

```haskell
class POrd t where
  (#<=) :: Term s t -> Term s t -> Term s PBool
  (#<) :: Term s t -> Term s t -> Term s PBool
```

It works as you would expect-

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

pif (1 #< 7) "indeed" "what"
```

evaluates to `"indeed"` - of type `Term s PString`.

### Monoids

You can use `<>` on two `Term s a`s to produce one `Term s a`, where `Term s a` is a `Semigroup`. You can use `mempty` to create a `Term s a`, where `Term s a` is a monoid.

It works the way you would expect, `PByteString` and `PString` terms have `Monoid` instances-

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

"ab" <> "cd"
-- evaluates to "abcd"
```

Where all those strings are actually `Term s PString`s.

### PIntegral
This is similar to the `Integral` typeclass. However, it only has the following class methods-
* `pdiv` - similar to `div`
* `pmod` - similar to `mod`
* `pquot` - similar to `quot`
* `prem` - similar to `prem`

Using these functions, you can do division/modulus etc on Plutarch level values-
```hs
pdiv # 6 # 3
```
where `6` and `3` are `Term s PInteger`s yields `2` - also a `Term s PInteger`.

### PIsData
The `PIsData` typeclass facilitates easy and type safe conversion between Plutarch types and their corresponding `PData` representation - i.e [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md). It keeps track of the type information through [`PAsData`](#pasdata).
```hs
class PIsData a where
  pfromData :: Term s (PAsData a) -> Term s a
  pdata :: Term s a -> Term s (PAsData a)
```

[`PInteger`](#pinteger) has a `PIsData` instance. The `PData` representation of `PInteger` is, of course, an `I` data. And you can get the `PInteger` back from an `I` data using `UnIData` (i.e `pasInt`).
```hs
instance PIsData PInteger where
  pfromData x = pasInt # pforgetData x
  pdata x = punsafeBuiltin PLC.IData # x
```
In essence, `pdata` wraps a `PInteger` into an `I` data value. Wheras `pfromData` simply unwraps the `I` data value to get a `PInteger`.

> Aside: You might be asking, what's an "`I` data value"? This is referring to the different constructors of `Data`/`BuiltinData`. You can find a full explanation of this at [plutonomicon](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md).

For the simple constructors that merely wrap a builtin type into `Data`, e.g integers, bytestrings, lists, and map, `PIsData` works in much the same way as above. However, what about `Constr` data values? When you have an ADT that doesn't correspond to those simple builtin types directly - but you still need to encode it as `Data` (e.g `PScriptContext`). In this case, you should [implement `PIsDataRepr`](#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends) and you'll get the `PIsData` instance for free!

### PConstant & PLift
These 2 closely tied together typeclasses establish a bridge between a Plutarch level type (that is represented as a builtin type, i.e [`DefaultUni`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-core/html/PlutusCore.html#t:DefaultUni)) and its corresponding Haskell synonym. The gory details of these two are not too useful to users, but you can read all about it if you want at [Developers' corner](./DEVGUIDE.md#pconstant-and-plift).

What's more important, are the abilities that `PConstant`/`PLift` instances have-
```hs
pconstant :: PLift p => PLifted p -> Term s p

plift :: (PLift p, HasCallStack) => ClosedTerm p -> PLifted p
```
> Aside: `PLifted p` represents the Haskell synonym to the Plutarch type, `p`. Similarly, there is also `PConstanted h` - which represents the Plutarch synonym corresponding to the Haskell type, `h`. These type families may only be used for Plutarch types implementing `PConstant`/`PLift`.

`pconstant` lets you build a Plutarch value from its corresponding Haskell synonym. For example, the haskell synonym of [`PBool`](#pbool) is [`Bool`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Data-Bool.html#t:Bool).
```hs
b :: Term s PBool
b = pconstant False
```
Other than simple builtin types - you can also use `pconstant` to create [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md) values! Usually, you'll want to keep the type information though - so here's an example of creating a `PScriptPurpose` from a familiar `ScriptPurpose` constant-
```hs
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Contexts

purp :: Term s PScriptPurpose
purp = pconstant $ Minting ""
```

On the other end, `plift` lets you obtain the Haskell synonym of a Plutarch value (that is represented as a builtin value, i.e [`DefaultUni`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-core/html/PlutusCore.html#t:DefaultUni))-
```hs
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Contexts

purp :: Term s PScriptPurpose
purp = pconstant $ Minting "be"

> plift purp
Minting "be"
```

#### Implementing `PConstant` & `PLift`
If your custom Plutarch type is represented by a builtin type under the hood (i.e not scott encoded - rather [`DefaultUni`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-core/html/PlutusCore.html#t:DefaultUni)) - you can easily implement `PLift` for it by using the provided machinery.

This comes in 3 flavors.
* Plutarch type represented **directly** by a builtin type that **is not** `Data` (`DefaultUniData`) ==> `DerivePConstantDirect`

  Ex: `PInteger` is directly represented as a builtin integer.
* Plutarch type represented **indirectly** by a builtin type that **is not** `Data` (`DefaultUniData`) ==> `DerivePConstantViaNewtype`

  Ex: `PPubKeyHash` is a newtype to a `PByteString`, `PByteString` is *directly* represented as a builtin bytestring.
* Plutarch type represented by `Data` (`DefaultUniData`) ==> `DerivePConstantViaData`

  Ex: `PScriptPurpose` is represented as a `Data` value. It is synonymous to `ScriptPurpose` from the Plutus ledger api.

Whichever path you need to go down, there is one common part- implementing `PLift`, or rather `PUnsafeLiftDecl`. See, `PLift` is actually just a type synonym to `PUnsafeLiftDecl`. Essentially an empty typeclass with an associated type family that provides insight on the relationship between a Plutarch type and its Haskell synonym.
```hs
instance PUnsafeLiftDecl YourPlutarchType where type PLifted YourPlutarchType = YourHaskellType
```
You're tasked with assigning the correct Haskell synonym to your Plutarch type, and what an important task it is! Recall that `pconstant`'s argument type will depend on your assignment here. In particular: `pconstant :: YourHaskellType -> YourPlutarchType`.

Some examples:-
* for `YourPlutarchType` = `PInteger`, `YourHaskellType` = `Integer`

  ```hs
  instance PUnsafeLiftDecl PInteger where type PLifted PInteger = Integer
  ```
* for `YourPlutarchType` = `PValidatorHash`, `YourHaskellType` = `ValidatorHash`

  ```hs
  instance PUnsafeLiftDecl PValidatorHash where type PLifted PValidatorHash = Plutus.ValidatorHash
  ```
* for `YourPlutarchType` = `PScriptPurpose`, `YourHaskellType` = `ScriptPurpose`

  ```hs
  instance PUnsafeLiftDecl PScriptPurpose where type PLifted PScriptPurpose = Plutus.ScriptPurpose
  ```

Now, let's get to implementing `PConstant` for the Haskell synonym, via the 3 methods. The first of which is `DerivePConstantDirect`-
```hs
deriving via (DerivePConstantDirect Integer PInteger) instance (PConstant Integer)
```
`DerivePConstantDirect` takes in 2 type parameters-
* The Haskell type itself, for which `PConstant` is being implemented for.
* The **direct** Plutarch synonym to the Haskell type.

Pretty simple! Let's check out `DerivePConstantViaNewtype` now-
```hs
import qualified Plutus.V1.Ledger.Api as Plutus

newtype PValidatorHash (s :: S) = PValidatorHash (Term s PByteString)

...

deriving via (DerivePConstantViaNewtype Plutus.ValidatorHash PValidatorHash PByteString) instance (PConstant Plutus.ValidatorHash)
```
`DerivePConstantViaNewtype` also takes in 3 type parameters-
* The Haskell newtype itself, for which `PConstant` is being implemented for.
* The Plutarch synonym to the Haskell type.
* The actual Plutarch type corresponding to the Haskell type contained within the newtype.

  E.g `ValidatorHash` is a newtype to a `ByteString`, which is synonymous to `PByteString`. In the same way, `PValidatorHash` is actually just a newtype to a `PByteString` term.
During runtime, `ValidatorHash` is actually just a `ByteString`, the same applies for `PValidatorHash`. So we give it the `newtype` treatment with `DerivePConstantViaNewtype`!

Finally, we have `DerivePConstantViaData` for `Data` values-
```hs
import qualified Plutus.V1.Ledger.Api as Plutus

data PScriptPurpose (s :: S)
  = PMinting (Term s (PDataList '[PCurrencySymbol]))
  | PSpending (Term s (PDataList '[PTxOutRef]))
  | PRewarding (Term s (PDataList '[PStakingCredential]))
  | PCertifying (Term s (PDataList '[PDCert]))

...

deriving via (DerivePConstantViaData Plutus.ScriptPurpose PScriptPurpose) instance (PConstant Plutus.ScriptPurpose)
```
`DerivePConstantViaData` takes in 2 type parameters-
* The Haskell type itself, for which `PConstant` is being implemented for.
* The Plutarch synonym to the Haskell type.
And that's all you need to know to implement `PConstant` and `PLift`!

### PlutusType, PCon, and PMatch
`PlutusType` lets you construct and deconstruct Plutus Core constants from from a Plutarch type's constructors (possibly containing other Plutarch terms). It's essentially a combination of `PCon` (for constant construction) and `PMatch` (for constant deconstruction).

```hs
class (PCon a, PMatch a) => PlutusType (a :: k -> Type) where
  type PInner a (b' :: k -> Type) :: k -> Type
  pcon' :: forall s. a s -> forall b. Term s (PInner a b)
  pmatch' :: forall s c. (forall b. Term s (PInner a b)) -> (a s -> Term s c) -> Term s c
```
`PInner` is meant to represent the "inner" type of `a` - the Plutarch type representing the Plutus Core constant used to represent `a`.

Here's the `PlutusType` instance for `PMaybe`-
```hs
data PMaybe a s = PJust (Term s a) | PNothing

instance PlutusType (PMaybe a) where
  type PInner (PMaybe a) b = (a :--> b) :--> PDelayed b :--> b
  pcon' :: forall s. PMaybe a s -> forall b. Term s (PInner (PMaybe a) b)
  pcon' (PJust x) = plam $ \f (_ :: Term _ _) -> f # x
  pcon' PNothing = plam $ \_ g -> pforce g
  pmatch' x f = x # (plam $ \inner -> f (PJust inner)) # (pdelay $ f PNothing)
```
This is a [scott encoded representation of the familiar `Maybe` data type](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding). As you can see, `PInner` of `PMaybe` is actually a Plutarch level function. And that's exactly why `pcon'` creates a *function*. `pmatch'`, then, simply "matches" on the function - scott encoding fashion.

You should always use `pcon` and `pmatch` instead of `pcon'` and `pmatch'` - these are provided by the `PCon` and `PMatch` typeclasses-
```hs
class PCon a where
  pcon :: a s -> Term s a

class PMatch a where
  pmatch :: Term s a -> (a s -> Term s b) -> Term s b
```

All `PlutusType` instances get `PCon` and `PMatch` instances for free!

For types that cannot easily be both `PCon` and `PMatch` - feel free to implement just one of them! However, in general, **prefer implementing `PlutusType`**!

#### Implementing `PlutusType` for your own types (Scott Encoding)
If you want to represent your data type with [scott encoding](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding) (and therefore not let it be `Data` encoded), you should simply derive it generically-
```hs
import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP
import Plutarch.Prelude

data MyType (a :: PType) (b :: PType) (s :: S)
  = One (Term s a)
  | Two (Term s b)
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic, PlutusType)
```
> Note: This requires the `generics-sop` package.

If you want to represent your data type as some simple builtin type (e.g integer, bytestrings, string/text, list, or assoc map), you can define your datatype as a `newtype` to the underlying builtin term and derive `PlutusType` using [`DerivePNewtype`](#deriving-typeclasses-for-newtypes).
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

newtype MyInt (s :: S) = MyInt (Term s PInteger)
  deriving (PlutusType) via (DerivePNewtype MyInt PInteger)
```

If you don't want it to be a newtype, but rather - an ADT, and still have it be represented as some simple builtin type - you can do so by implementing `PlutusType` manually. Here's an example of encoding a Sum type as an Enum via `PInteger`-
```hs
import Plutarch
import Plutarch.Prelude

data AB (s :: S) = A | B

instance PlutusType AB where
  type PInner AB _ = PInteger

  pcon' A = 0
  pcon' B = 1

  pmatch' x f =
    pif (x #== 0) (f A) (f B)
```
#### Implementing `PlutusType` for your own types (Data Encoding)
If your type is supposed to be represented using [`Data` encoding](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding) instead (i.e has a [`PIsDataRepr`](#pisdatarepr--pdatafields) instance), you can derive `PlutusType` via `PIsDataReprInstances`
```hs
import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP
import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.DataRepr

data MyType (a :: PType) (b :: PType) (s :: S)
  = One (Term s (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= a ]))
  | Two (Term s (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= b ]))
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic)
  deriving anyclass (PIsDataRepr)
  deriving
    (PlutusType, PIsData)
    via PIsDataReprInstances (MyType a b)
```

### PListLike
The `PListLike` typeclass bestows beautiful, and familiar, list utilities to its instances. Plutarch has two list types- [`PBuiltinList`](#pbuiltinlist) and [`PList`](#plist). Both have `PListLike` instances! However, `PBuiltinList` can only contain builtin types. It cannot contain Plutarch functions. The element type of `PBuiltinList` can be constrained using `PLift a => PBuiltinList a`.

> Note: `PLift` is exported from `Plutarch.Lift`.

As long as it's a `PLift a => PBuiltinList a` or `PList a` - it has access to all the `PListLike` goodies, out of the box. It helps to look into some of these functions at [`Plutarch.List`](./../Plutarch/List.hs).

Along the way, you might be confronted by 2 big mean baddies ...err, constraints-
```hs
PIsListLike list a
```
This just means that the type `list a`, is *indeed* a valid `PListLike` containing valid elements! Of course, all `PList a`s are valid `PListLike`, but we have to think about `PBuiltinList` since it can only contain `PLift a => a` elements! So, in essence a function declared as-
```hs
pfoo :: PIsListLike list a => Term s (list a :--> list a)
```
when specialized to `PBuiltinList`, can be simplified as-
```hs
pfoo :: PLift a => Term s (PBuiltinList a :--> PBuiltinList a)
```
That's all it is. Don't be scared of it!

What about this one-
```hs
PElemConstraint list a
```
This one ensures that the element type `a` can indeed be contained within the list type - `list`. For `PList`, this constraint means nothing - it's always true. For `PBuiltinList`, it can be simplified as `PLift a`. Easy!

Here's two of my favorite `PListLike` utilities (not biased)-
```hs
-- | Cons an element onto an existing list.
pcons :: PElemConstraint list a => Term s (a :--> list a :--> list a)

-- | The empty list
pnil :: PElemConstraint list a => Term s (list a)
```
What would life be without cons and nil?

Let's build a `PBuiltinList` of `PInteger`s with that-
```hs
x :: Term s (PBuiltinList PInteger)
x = pcons # 1 #$ pcons # 2 #$ pcons # 3 # pnil
```
Wooo! Let's not leave `PList` alone in the corner though-
```hs
x :: Term s (PList PInteger)
x = pcons # 1 #$ pcons # 2 #$ pcons # 3 # pnil
```
The code is the same, we just changed the type annotation. Cool!

### PIsDataRepr & PDataFields
`PIsDataRepr` allows for easily constructing *and* deconstructing `Constr` [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md) values. It allows fully type safe matching on `Data` values, without embedding type information within the generated script - unlike PlutusTx. `PDataFields`, on top of that, allows for ergonomic field access.

> Aside: What's a `Constr` data value? Briefly, it's how Plutus Core encodes non-trivial ADTs into `Data`/`BuiltinData`. It's essentially a sum-of-products encoding. But you don't have to care too much about any of this. Essentially, whenever you have a custom non-trivial ADT (that isn't just an integer, bytestring, string/text, list, or assoc map), you should implement `PIsDataRepr` for it.

For example, `PScriptContext` - which is the Plutarch synonym to [`ScriptContext`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-ledger-api/html/Plutus-V1-Ledger-Contexts.html#t:ScriptContext) - has the necessary instances. This lets you easily keep track of its type, match on it, deconstruct it - you name it!
```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P

foo :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PString)
foo = plam $ \ctx -> P.do
  purpose <- pmatch . pfromData $ pfield @"purpose" # ctx
  case purpose of
    PMinting _ -> "It's minting!"
    PSpending _ -> "It's spending!"
    PRewarding _ -> "It's rewarding!"
    PCertifying _ -> "It's certifying!"
```
> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo`). Be sure to check out [how to translate the do syntax to GHC 8](#translating-do-syntax-with-qualifieddo-to-ghc-8).

Of course, just like `ScriptContext` - `PScriptContext` is represented as a `Data` value in Plutus Core. Plutarch just lets you keep track of the *exact representation* of it within the type system.

Here's how `PScriptContext` is defined-
```hs
newtype PScriptContext (s :: S)
  = PScriptContext
      ( Term
          s
          ( PDataRecord
              '[ "txInfo" ':= PTxInfo
               , "purpose" ':= PScriptPurpose
               ]
          )
      )
```
It's a constructor containing a [`PDataRecord`](#pdatasum--pdatarecord) term. It has 2 fields- `txInfo` and `purpose`.

First, we extract the `purpose` field using `pfield @"purpose"`-
```hs
pfield :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PAsData PScriptPurpose)
```
> Note: When extracting several fields from the same variable, you should instead use `pletFields`. See: [Extracting fields](#all-about-extracting-fields)

Now, we can grab the `PScriptPurpose` from within the `PAsData` using `pfromData`-
```hs
pfromData :: Term s (PAsData PScriptPurpose) -> Term s PScriptPurpose
```
Finally, we can `pmatch` on it to extract the Haskell ADT (`PScriptPurpose s`) out of the Plutarch term-
```hs
pmatch :: Term s PScriptPurpose -> (PScriptPurpose s -> Term s PString) -> Term s PString
```
Now that we have `PScriptPurpose s`, we can just `case` match on it! `PScriptPurpose` is defined as-
```hs
data PScriptPurpose (s :: S)
  = PMinting (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol]))
  | PSpending (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PTxOutRef]))
  | PRewarding (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PStakingCredential]))
  | PCertifying (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PDCert]))
```
It's just a Plutarch sum type.

We're not really interested in the fields (the `PDataRecord` term), so we just match on the constructor with the familar `case`. Easy!

Let's pass in a `ScriptContext` as a `Data` value from Haskell to this Plutarch script and see if it works!
```hs
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Api

mockCtx :: ScriptContext
mockCtx =
  ScriptContext
    (TxInfo
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      (interval (POSIXTime 1) (POSIXTime 2))
      mempty
      mempty
      ""
    )
    (Minting (CurrencySymbol ""))

> foo `evalWithArgsT` [PlutusTx.toData mockCtx]
Right (Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf string "It's minting!"))))
```

#### All about extracting fields
We caught a glimpse of field extraction in the example above, thanks to `pfield`. However, that barely touched the surface.

Once a type has a `PDataFields` instance, field extraction can be done with these 3 functions-
* `pletFields`
* `pfield`
* `hrecField` (when not using `RecordDotSyntax` or record dot preprocessor)

Each has its own purpose. However, `pletFields` is arguably the most general purpose and most efficient. Whenever you need to extract several fields from the same variable, you should use `pletFields`-
```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RecordDotSyntax #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P

foo :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PUnit)
foo = plam $ \ctx' -> P.do
  ctx <- pletFields @["txInfo", "purpose"] ctx'
  let
    purpose = ctx.purpose
    txInfo = ctx.txInfo
  -- <use purpose and txInfo here>
  pconstant ()
```
> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo` and `RecordDotSyntax`). Be sure to check out [how to translate the do syntax to GHC 8](#translating-do-syntax-with-qualifieddo-to-ghc-8) and [alternatives to `RecordDotSyntax`](#alternatives-to-recorddotsyntax).

In essence, `pletFields` takes in a type level list of the field names that you want to access and a continuation function that takes in an `HRec`. This `HRec` is essentially a collection of the bound fields. You don't have to worry too much about the details of `HRec`. This particular usage has type-
```hs
pletFields :: Term s PScriptContext
  -> (HRec
        (BoundTerms
           '[ "txInfo" ':= PTxInfo, "purpose" ':= PScriptPurpose]
           '[ 'Bind, 'Bind]
           s)
      -> Term s PUnit)
  -> Term s PUnit
```
> Aside: Of course, we used the convenient `do` syntax provided to us by `Plutarch.Monadic` to write the continuation merely as a `<-` bind. Without do notation, you'd have to write-
>
> ```hs
> pletFields @["txInfo", "purpose"] ctx' $ \ctx ->
>   let
>     purpose = ctx.purpose
>     txInfo = ctx.txInfo
>   in pconstant ()
> ```

You can then access the fields on this `HRec` using `RecordDotSyntax`.

Next up is `pfield`. You should *only ever* use this if you just want one field from a variable and no more. It's usage is simply `pfield @"fieldName" # variable`. You can, however, also use `pletFields` in this case (e.g `pletFoelds @'["fieldName"] variable`). `pletFields` with a singular field has the same efficiency as `pfield`!

Finally, `hrecField` is merely there to supplement the lack of record dot syntax. See: [Alternative to `RecordDotSyntax`](#alternative-to-recorddotsyntax).

##### Alternatives to `RecordDotSyntax`
If `RecordDotSyntax` is not available, you can also try using the [record dot preprocessor plugin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/record-dot-preprocessor).

If you don't want to use either, you can simply use `hrecField`. In fact, `ctx.purpose` above just translates to `hrecField @"purpose" ctx`. Nothing magical there!

#### All about constructing data values
We learned about type safe matching (through `PlutusType`) as well as type safe field access (through `PDataFields`) - how about construction? Since `PIsDataRepr` allows you to derive [`PlutusType`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch), and `PlutusType` bestows the ability to not only *deconstruct*, but also **construct** values - you can do that just as easily!

Let's see how we could build a `PMinting` `PScriptPurpose` given a `PCurrencySymbol`-
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.V1

currSym :: Term s PCurrencySymbol
```
```hs
purpose :: Term s PScriptPurpose
purpose = pcon $ PMinting fields
  where
    currSymDat :: Term _ (PAsData PCurrencySymbol)
    currSymDat = pdata currSym
    fields :: Term _ (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol ])
    fields = pdcons # currSymDat # pdnil
```
All the type annotations are here to help!

This is just like regular `pcon` usage you've [seen above](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch). It takes in the Haskell ADT of your Plutarch type and gives back a Plutarch term.

What's more interesting, is the `fields` binding. Recall that `PMinting` is a constructor with one argument, that argument is a [`PDataRecord`](#pdatasum--pdatarecord) term. In particular, we want: `Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol ])`. It encodes the exact type, position, and name of the field. So, all we have to do is create a `PDataRecord` term!

Of course, we do that using `pdcons` - which is just the familiar `cons` specialized for `PDataRecord` terms.
```hs
pdcons :: forall label a l s. Term s (PAsData a :--> PDataRecord l :--> PDataRecord ((label ':= a) ': l))
```
It takes a `PAsData a` and adds that `a` to the `PDataRecord` heterogenous list. We feed it a `PAsData PCurrencySymbol` and `pdnil` - the empty data record. That should give us-
```hs
pdcons # currSymDat # pdnil :: Term _ (PDataRecord '[ label ':= PCurrencySymbol ])
```
Cool! Wait, what's `label`? It's the field name associated with the field, in our case, we want the field name to be `_0` - because that's what the `PMinting` constructor wants. You can either specify the label with a type application or you can just have a type annotation for the binding (which is what we do here). Or you can let GHC try and match up the `label` with the surrounding environment!

Now that we have `fields`, we can use it with `PMinting` to build a `PScriptPurpose s` and feed it to `pcon` - we're done!

#### Implementing PIsDataRepr and friends
Implementing these is rather simple with generic deriving + `PIsDataReprInstances`. All you need is a well formed type using `PDataRecord`. For example, suppose you wanted to implement `PIsDataRepr` for the Plutarch version of this Haskell type-
```hs
data Vehicle
  = FourWheeler Integer Integer Integer Integer
  | TwoWheeler Integer Integer
  | ImmovableBox
```
You'd declare the corresponding Plutarch type as-
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

data PVehicle (s :: S)
  = PFourWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger, "_2" ':= PInteger, "_3" ':= PInteger]))
  | PTwoWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger]))
  | PImmovableBox (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
```
> Note: The constructor ordering in `PVehicle` matters! If you used [`makeIsDataIndexed`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx.html#v:makeIsDataIndexed) on `Vehicle` to assign an index to each constructor - the Plutarch type's constructors must follow the same indexing order.
>
> In this case, `PFourWheeler` is at the 0th index, `PTwoWheeler` is at the 1st index, and `PImmovableBox` is at the 3rd index. Thus, the corresponding `makeIsDataIndexed` usage should be-
>
> ```hs
> PlutusTx.makeIsDataIndexed ''FourWheeler [('FourWheeler,0),('TwoWheeler,1),('ImmovableBox,2)]
> ```
> Also see: [Isomorphism between Haskell ADTs and `PIsDataRepr`](#the-isomorphism-between-makeisdataindexed-haskell-adts-and-pisdatarepr)

And you'd simply derive `PIsDataRepr` using generics. However, you **must** also derive `PIsData` using `PIsDataReprInstances`. Moreover, you should also derive `PlutusType`. For single constructor data types, you should also derive `PDataFields`.

> Aside: If your type is *not* a sumtype, but rather a newtype with a single constructor - you should also derive `PDataFields`. In the case of sumtypes, the existing `PDataFields` instance for `PDataRecord` will be enough.

Combine all that, and you have-
```hs
import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP (Generic)

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.DataRepr

data PVehicle (s :: S)
  = PFourWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger, "_2" ':= PInteger, "_3" ':= PInteger]))
  | PTwoWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger]))
  | PImmovableBox (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic)
  deriving anyclass (PIsDataRepr)
  deriving
    (PlutusType, PIsData)
    via PIsDataReprInstances PVehicle
```
> Note: You cannot implement `PIsDataRepr` for types that are represented using [scott encoding](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding). Your types must be well formed and should be using `PDataRecord` terms instead.

That's it! Now you can represent `PVehicle` as a `Data` value, as well as deconstruct and access its fields super ergonomically. Let's try it!
```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RecordDotSyntax #-}

import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P
import Plutarch.Prelude

test :: Term s (PVehicle :--> PInteger)
test = plam $ \veh' -> P.do
  veh <- pmatch veh'
  case veh of
    PFourWheeler fwh' -> P.do
      fwh <- pletFields @'["_0", "_1", "_2", "_3"] fwh'
      pfromData fwh._0 + pfromData fwh._1 + pfromData fwh._2 + pfromData fwh._3
    PTwoWheeler twh' -> P.do
      twh <- pletFields @'["_0", "_1"] twh'
      pfromData twh._0 + pfromData twh._1
    PImmovableBox _ -> 0
```
> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo` and `RecordDotSyntax`). Be sure to check out [how to translate the do syntax to GHC 8](#translating-do-syntax-with-qualifieddo-to-ghc-8) and [alternatives to `RecordDotSyntax`](#alternatives-to-recorddotsyntax).

What about types with singular constructors? It's quite similar to the sum type case. Here's how it looks-
```hs
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP (Generic)

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.DataRepr

newtype PFoo (s :: S) = PMkFoo (Term s (PDataRecord '["foo" ':= PByteString]))
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic)
  deriving anyclass (PIsDataRepr)
  deriving
    (PlutusType, PIsData, PDataFields)
    via PIsDataReprInstances PFoo
```
Just an extra `PDataFields` derivation compared to the sum type usage! (oh and also the ominous `UndecidableInstances`)

## Working with Types

### PInteger
`Term s PInteger` has a convenient `Num` instance that allows you to construct Plutarch level integer terms from regular literals. It also means you have all the typical arithmetic operations available to you-

```haskell
1 + 2
```

where `1` and `2` are `Term s PInteger`s.

Alongside `Num`, it also has a `PIntegral` instance, allowing you to division, modulus etc.

It also has a `PEq` and `POrd` instance, allowing you to do Plutarch level equality and comparison.

It **does not** have a `PlutusType` instance.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin integer](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins.html#t:Integer).

### PBool

Plutarch level boolean terms can be constructed using `pconstant True` and `pconstant False`.

```haskell
pif (pconstant PFalse) 7 42
-- evaluates to 42
```
You can combine Plutarch booleans terms using `#&&` and `#||`, which are synonyms to `&&` and `||`. These are haskell level operators and therefore have short circuiting. If you don't need short circuiting, you can use the Plutarch level alternatives- `pand'` and `por'` respectively.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin boolean](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins-Internal.html#t:BuiltinBool).

### PString

`Term s PString` has a `IsString` instance. This allows you to make Plutarch level string terms from regular string literals, provided you have `OverloadedStrings` turned on.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

"foo"
```

where &quot;foo&quot; is actually `Term s PString`.

It also has a `PEq` instance. And its terms have  `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances - which work the way you would expect.

It **does not** have a `PlutusType` instance.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin string](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins.html#t:BuiltinString) (actually Text).

### PByteString

Plutarch level bytestring terms can be created using `phexByteStr` and `pbyteStr`. `phexByteStr` interprets a hex string literal as a `Term s PByteString` and `pbyteStr` merely converts a `ByteString` into a `Term s PByteString`.

```haskell
import qualified Data.ByteString as BS

phexByteStr "41"
-- yields a `Term s PByteString`, which represents [65]

pbyteStr (BS.pack [91])
-- yields a `Term s PByteString`, which represents [91]
```

Similar to `PString`, it has a `PEq` instance. As well as `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for its terms.

It **does not** have a `PlutusType` instance.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin bytestring](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins.html#t:BuiltinByteString).

### PUnit

The Plutarch level unit term can be constructed using `pconstant ()`.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin unit](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins-Internal.html#t:BuiltinUnit).

### PBuiltinList
You'll be using builtin lists quite a lot in Plutarch. `PBuiltinList` has a [`PListLike`](#plistlike) instance, giving you access to all the goodies from there! However, `PBuiltinList` can only contain builtin types. In particular, it cannot contain Plutarch functions.

You can express the constraint of "only builtin types" using `PLift`, exported from `Plutarch.Builtin`-`
```hs
validBuiltinList :: PLift a => PBuiltinList a
```
As mentioned before, `PBuiltinList` gets access to all the `PListLike` utilities. Other than that, `PLift a => PBuiltinList a` also has a [`PlutusType`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch) instance. You can construct a `PBuiltinList` using `pcon` (but you should prefer using `pcons` from `PListLike`)-
```hs
> pcon $ PCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PNil
```
would yield a `PBuiltinList PByteString` with one element - `0xfe`. Of course, you could have done that with `pcons # phexByteStr "fe" # pnil` instead!

You can also use `pmatch` to match on a list-
```hs
pmatch (pcon $ PCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PNil) $ \case
  PNil -> "hey hey there's nothing here!"
  PCons _ _ -> "oooo fancy!"
```
But you should prefer `pelimList` from `PListLike` instead-
```hs
pelimList (\_ _ -> "oooo fancy") "hey hey there's nothing here!" $ pcon $ PCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PNil
```
The first argument is a function that is invoked for the `PCons` case, with the head and tail of the list as arguments.

The second argument is the value to return when the list is empty. It's *only evaluated* **if the list is empty**.

The final argument is, of course, the list itself.

> Aside: Interested in the lower level details of `PBuiltinList` (i.e Plutus Core builtin lists)? You can find all you need to know about it at [plutonomicon](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-lists.md).

### PList
Here's the scott encoded cousin of `PBuiltinList`. What does that mean? Well, in practice, it just means that `PList` can contain *any arbitrary* term - not just builtin types. `PList` also has a [`PListLike`](#plistlike) instance - so you won't be missing any of those utilities here!

`PList` also has a [`PlutusType`](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch) instance. You can construct a `PList` using `pcon` (but you should prefer using `pcons` from `PListLike`)-
```hs
> pcon $ PSCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PSNil
```
would yield a `PList PByteString` with one element - `0xfe`. Of course, you could have done that with ``pcons # phexByteStr "fe" # pnil`` instead!

You can also use `pmatch` to match on a list-
```hs
pmatch (pcon $ PSCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PSNil) $ \case
  PSNil -> "hey hey there's nothing here!"
  PSCons _ _ -> "oooo fancy!"
```
But you should prefer `pelimList` from `PListLike` instead-
```hs
pelimList (\_ _ -> "oooo fancy") "hey hey there's nothing here!" $ pcon $ PSCons (phexByteStr "fe") $ pcon PSNil
```

### PBuiltinPair
Much like in the case of builtin lists, you'll just be working with builtin functions (or rather, Plutarch synonyms to builtin functions) here. You can find everything about that in [builtin-pairs](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-pairs.md). Feel free to only read the `Plutarch` examples.

### PAsData
This is a typed way of representing [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md). It is highly encouraged you use `PAsData` to keep track of what "species" of `Data` value you actually have. `Data` can be a `Constr` (for sum of products - ADTs), `Map` (for wrapping assoc maps of Data to Data), `List` (for wrapping builtin lists of data), `I` (for wrapping builtin integers), and `B` (for wrapping builtin bytestrings).

> Aside: You might be asking, what's an "`I` data value"? This is referring to the different constructors of `Data`/`BuiltinData`. You can find a full explanation of this at [plutonomicon](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md).

Consider a function that takes in and returns a `B` data value - aka `ByteString` as a `Data` value. If you use the direct Plutarch synonym to `Data` - `PData`, you'd have-
```hs
foo :: Term s (PData :--> PData)
```
That's not very informative - you have no way to ensure that you're actually working with `B` data values. You could use `PAsData` instead-
```hs
foo :: Term s (PAsData PByteString :--> PAsData PByteString)
```
Now, you have assurance that you're working with a `Data` value that actually represents a builtin bytestring!

`PAsData` also makes deconstructing data simple and type safe. When working with raw `PData`, you might find yourself using `pasConstr`, `pasList` etc. on the type `PData`. If `PData` wasn't actually a `Constr` data value - `pasConstr` would cause an evaluation error at runtime.

Instead, you should use `pfromData` (from the typeclass `PIsData`) which will use the correct builtin function depending on the type of `PAsData` you have. Some useful instances of it are-
```hs
pfromData :: Term s (PAsData PInteger) -> Term s PInteger

pfromData :: Term s (PAsData PByteString) -> Term s PByteString

pfromData :: Term s (PAsData (PBuiltinList (PAsData a))) -> Term s (PBuiltinList (PAsData a))
```

You can also create a `PAsData` value from supported types, using `pdata`. Some of the useful instances of it are-
```hs
pdata :: Term s PInteger -> Term s (PAsData PInteger)

pdata :: Term s PByteString -> Term s (PAsData PByteString)

pdata :: Term s (PBuiltinList (PAsData a)) -> Term s (PAsData (PBuiltinList (PAsData a)))
```

In general, if `PIsData T => T` is a Plutarch type (that can be converted to and from `Data`), `PAsData T` is its `Data` representation.

You can also create a `PAsData` from a `PData`, but you lose specific type information along the way-
```hs
pdata :: Term s PData -> Term s (PAsData PData)
```

### PDataSum & PDataRecord
Plutarch sum and product types are represented using `PDataSum` and `PDataRecord` respectively. These types are crucial to the [`PIsDataRepr`](#pisdatarepr) machinery.

Whenever you need to represent a non-trivial ADT using [`Data` encoding](#data-encoding-and-scott-encoding), you'll likely be reaching for these.

More often than not, you'll be using `PDataRecord`. This is used to denote all the fields of a constructor-
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

newtype Foo (s :: S) = Foo (Term s (PDataRecord '["fooField" ':= PInteger]))
```
`Foo` is a Plutarch type with a single constructor with a single field, named `fooField`, of type `PInteger`. You can [implement `PIsDataRepr`](#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends) for it so that `PAsData Foo` is represented as a `Constr` encoded data value.

You can build `PDataRecord` terms using `pdcons` and `pdnil`. These are the familiar `cons` and `nil` specialized to `PDataRecord` terms.
```hs
pdcons :: forall label a l s. Term s (PAsData a :--> PDataRecord l :--> PDataRecord ((label ':= a) ': l))

pdnil :: Term s (PDataRecord '[])
```
To add an `a` to the `PDataRecord` term, you must have a `PAsData a`. The other type variable of interest, is `label`. This is just the name of the field you're adding. You can either use type application to specify the field, or use a type annotation, or let GHC match up the types.

Here's how you'd build a `PDataRecord` with two integer fields, one is named `foo`, the other is named `bar`-
```hs
test ::
test = pdcons @"foo" @PInteger # 7 #$ pdcons @"bar" @PInteger # 42 # pnil
```

`PDataSum` on the other hand, is more "free-standing". In particular, the following type-
```hs
PDataSum
  [ '[ "_0" ':= PInteger
     , "_1" ':= PByteString
     ]
  , '[ "myField" ':= PBool
     ]
  ]
```
represents a sum type with 2 constructors. The first constructor has 2 fields- `_0`, and `_1`, with types `PInteger` and `PByteString` respectively. The second constructor has one field- `myField`, with type `PBool`.
> Note: It's convention to give names like `_0`, `_1` etc. to fields that don't have a canonically meaningful name. They are merely the "0th field", "1st field" etc.

### PRecord

You can define and use product ADTs, including records with named fields in Plutarch similar to Haskell's records. For a
Haskell data type like

```hs
data Circle = Circle{
  x, y :: Integer,
  radius :: Natural
  }
```

the equivalent in Plutarch would be

```hs
data Circle f = Circle{
  x, y :: f PInteger,
  radius :: f PNatural
  }
Plutarch.Rec.TH.deriveAll ''Circle
```

Each field type needs to be wrapped into the type parameter `f` of kind `PType -> Type`. This is a slight modification
of a common coding style known as Higher-Kinded Data.

With this definition, `PRecord Circle` will be an instance of [PlutusType](#plutustype-pcon-and-pmatch), so you can use
the usual `pcon` and `pcon'` to construct its value and `pmatch` and `pmatch'` to de-construct it:

```hs
circle :: Term s (PRecord Circle)
circle = pcon $ PRecord Circle{
  x = 100,
  y = 100,
  radius = 50
  }

distanceFromOrigin :: Term s (PRecord Circle :--> PNatural)
distanceFromOrigin = plam $ flip pmatch $ \(PRecord Circle{x, y})-> sqrt #$ projectAbs #$ x * x + y * y
```

You may also find `rcon` and `rmatch` from `Plutarch.Rec` a bit more convenient because they don't require the `PRecord`
wrapper. Alternatively, instead of using `pmatch` or its alternatives you can access individual fields using the `field`
accessor from the same module:

```hs
containsOrigin :: Term s (PRecord Circle :--> PBool)
containsOrigin = plam $ \c-> distanceFromOrigin # c #< pto c # field radius
```

#### letrec

You can use records to define mutually-recursive functions, or more generally (but less usefully) mutually-recursive values.

```hs
circleFixedPoint :: Term s (PRecord Circle)
circleFixedPoint = punsafeFrom $ letrec $ \Circle{y, radius}-> Circle{
  x = y,
  y = 2 * radius,
  radius = 50
  }
```

#### Record Data

You can provide a `PIsData` instance for `PRecord Circle` using the following definition:

```hs
instance RecordFromData Circle
instance PIsData (PRecord Circle) where
  pfromData = readData $ recordFromFieldReaders Circle{
    x = DataReader pfromData,
    y = DataReader pfromData,
    radius = DataReader pfromData
    }
  pdata = writeData $ recordDataFromFieldWriters Circle{
    x = DataWriter pdata,
    y = DataWriter pdata,
    radius = DataWriter pdata
    }
```

If your record has many fields and you only need to a couple of them from `Data`, it's more efficient to use `pfromData`
only on individual fields. You can focus on a single field using the function `fieldFromData`:

```hs
radiusFromCircleData :: Term s (PAsData (PRecord Circle) :--> PAsData PNatural)
radiusFromCircleData = fieldFromData radius
```

### PData
This is a direct synonym to [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md). As such, it doesn't keep track of what "species" of `Data` it actually is. Is it an `I` data? Is it a `B` data? Nobody can tell for sure!

Consider using [`PAsData`](#pasdata) instead for simple cases, i.e cases other than `Constr`.

Consider using [`PDataSum`/`PDataList`](#PDataSum--pdatalist) instead when dealing with ADTs, i.e `Constr` data values.

You can find more information about `PData` at [Developers' Corner](./DEVGUIDE.md).

# Examples
Be sure to check out [Compiling and Running](#compiling-and-running) first!

## Fibonacci number at given index
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

fib :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger)
fib = phoistAcyclic $
  pfix #$ plam $ \self n ->
    pif
      (n #== 0)
      0
      $ pif
        (n #== 1)
        1
        $ self # (n - 1) + self # (n - 2)
```
from [examples](../examples).

Execution-
```hs
> evalT $ fib # 2
Right (Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf integer 2))))
```

## Validator that always succeeds
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import Plutarch.Api.Scripts

alwaysSucceeds :: Term s (PDatum :--> PRedeemer :--> PScriptContext :--> PUnit)
alwaysSucceeds = plam $ \datm redm ctx -> pconstant ()
```
All the arguments are ignored. So we use the generic `PDatum` and `PRedeemer` types.

Execution-
```hs
> alwaysSucceeds `evalWithArgsT` [PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData ()]
Right (Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf unit ()))))
```

## Validator that always fails
```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.Contexts
import Plutarch.Api.Scripts

alwaysFails :: Term s (PDatum :--> PRedeemer :--> PScriptContext :--> PUnit)
alwaysFails = plam $ \datm redm ctx -> perror
```
Similar to the example above.

Execution-
```hs
> alwaysFails `evalWithArgsT` [PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData ()]
Left (EvaluationError [] "(CekEvaluationFailure,Nothing)")
```

## Validator that checks whether a value is present within signatories
```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}

checkSignatory :: Term s (PPubKeyHash :--> PDatum :--> PRedeemer :--> PScriptContext :--> PUnit)
checkSignatory = plam $ \ph _ _ ctx' -> P.do
  ctx <- pletFields @["txInfo", "purpose"] ctx'
  let
    purpose = pfromData ctx.purpose
    txInfo = pfromData ctx.txInfo
  PSpending _ <- pmatch purpose
  let signatories = pfromData $ pfield @"signatories" # txInfo
  pif (pelem # pdata ph # signatories)
    -- Success!
    (pconstant ())
    -- Signature not present.
    perror
```

We match on the script purpose to see if its actually for *spending* - and we get the signatories field from `txInfo` (the 7th field), check if given pub key hash is present within the signatories and that's it!

It's important that we pass a `PPubKeyHash` *prior* to treating `checkSignatory` as a validator script.
```hs
hashStr :: String
hashStr = "abce0f123e"

pubKeyHash :: Term s PPubKeyHash
pubKeyHash = pcon $ PPubKeyHash $ phexByteStr hashStr

mockCtx :: ScriptContext
mockCtx =
  ScriptContext
    (TxInfo

      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      (interval (POSIXTime 1) (POSIXTime 2))
      [fromString hashStr, "f013", "ab45"]
      mempty
      ""
    )
    (Spending (TxOutRef "" 1))

> evalWithArgsT (checkSignatory # pubKeyHash) [PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData (), PlutusTx.toData mockCtx]
Right (Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf unit ()))))
```

## Using custom datum/redeemer in your Validator
All you have to do is [implement `PIsDataRepr` and friends](#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends) for your custom datum/redeemer and you can use it just like `PScriptContext` in your validators!

# Thumb rules, Tips, and Tricks

## Plutarch functions are strict

All Plutarch functions are strict. When you apply a Plutarch function to an argument using `papp` (or `#`/`#$` - synonyms to `papp`) - the argument will be evaluated before being passed into to the function. If you don't want the argument to be evaluated, you can use `pdelay`.

## Don't duplicate work

Consider the simple snippet-

```haskell
pf :: Term s PInteger
pf = let foo = 1 + 2 in pif (foo #== 3) foo 7
```

If you use `printTerm` on this, you'll notice that the computation bound to `foo` is inlined twice-

```
(program 1.0.0 ((\\i0 -> force (i1 (equalsInteger (addInteger 1 2) 3) (delay (addInteger 1 2)) (delay 7))) (force ifThenElse)))
```

Notice how the `addInteger` computation is present _twice_. In these cases, you should use `plet` to compute once and re-use the computed value-

```haskell
pf :: Term s PInteger
pf = plet (1 + 3) $ \foo -> pif (foo #== 3) foo 7
```

Here's another example of this, Haskell level functions-

```haskell
abs :: Term s PInteger -> Term s PInteger
abs x = pif (x #<= -1) (negate x) x
```

`x` is going to be inlined _three_ times there. That's really bad if it's a big computation. This is what you should do instead-

```haskell
abs :: Term s PInteger -> Term s PInteger
abs x' = plet x' $ \x -> pif (x #<= -1) (negate x) x
```

Of course, what you _really_ should do , is prefer Plutarch level functions whenever possible.

### Where should arguments be `plet`ed?
You don't have to worry about work duplication on arguments in *every single scenario*. In particular, the argument to `plam` is also a Haskell function, isn't it? But you don't need to worry about `plet`ing your arguments there since it becomes a Plutarch level function through `plam` - thus, all the arguments are evaluated before being passed in.

Where else is `plet` unnecessary? Continuation functions! Specifically, the functions you pass to `plet` (duh), `pmatch`, `pletFields` and the like. This also means that when you use a `case` expression within the `pmatch` continuation function - you don't need to `plet` the fields within your pattern match. It should all be evaluated before being passed in to your continuation function.

You should also `plet` local bindings! In particular, if you applied a function (whether it be Plutarch level or Haskell level) to obtain a value, bound the value to a variable (using `let` or `where`) - don't use it multiple times! The binding will simply get inlined as the function application - and it'll keep getting re-evaluated. You should `plet` it first!

This also applies to field accesses using `RecordDotSyntax`. When you do `ctx.purpose`, it really gets translated to `hrecField @"purpose" ctx` - that's a function call! If you use the field multiple times, `plet` it first.

## Prefer Plutarch level functions

Plutarch level functions have a lot of advantages - they can be hoisted; they are strict so you can [use their arguments however many times you like without duplicating work](#dont-duplicate-work); they are required for Plutarch level higher order functions etc. Unless you _really_ need laziness, like `pif` does, try to use Plutarch level functions.

Also see: [Hoisting](#hoisting-metaprogramming--and-fundamentals).

## When to use Haskell level functions?
Although you should generally [prefer Plutarch level functions](#prefer-plutarch-level-functions), there are times when a Haskell level function is actually much better. However, figuring out *when* that is the case - is a delicate art.

There is one simple and straightforward usecase though, when you want a function argument to be lazily evaluated. In such a case, you should use a Haskell level functions that `pdelay`s the argument before calling some Plutarch level function. Recall that [Plutarch level functions are strict](#plutarch-functions-are-strict).

Outside of that straightforward usecase, figuring out when to use Haskell level functions is quite complex. Haskell level functions will always be inlined when generating the Plutus Core. Unless the function is used *only once*, this sort of inlining will increase the script size - which is problematic.

However, if the function is used *only once*, and making it Plutarch level causes extra `plam`s and `#`s to be introduced - you should just make it Haskell level. For example, consider the `pelimList` implementation-
```hs
pelimList :: PLift a => Term s (a :--> PBuiltinList a :--> r) -> Term s r -> Term s (PBuiltinList a) -> Term s r
pelimList match_cons match_nil ls = pmatch ls $ \case
  PCons x xs -> match_cons # x # xs
  PNil -> match_nil
```
It takes in a Plutarch level function, let's see a typical usage-
```hs
pelimList
  (plam $ \x xs -> pcons # x # (self # xs))
  pnil
  ls
```
This is rather redundant, the above snippet will exhibit inlining to produce-
```hs
pmatch ls $ \case
  PCons x xs -> (plam $ \x xs -> pcons # x # (self # xs)) # x # xs
  PNil -> match_nil
```
Extra `plam`s and `#`s have been introduced. Really, `pelimList` could have taken a Haskell level function instead-
```hs
pelimList :: PLift a => (Term s a -> Term s (PBuiltinList a) :--> Term s r) -> Term s r -> Term s (PBuiltinList a) -> Term s r
pelimList match_cons match_nil ls = pmatch ls $ \case
  PCons x xs -> match_cons x xs
  PNil -> match_nil
```
Now, the following usage-
```hs
pelimList
  (\x xs -> pcons # x # (self # xs))
  pnil
  ls
```
would turn into-
```hs
pmatch ls $ \case
  PCons x xs -> pcons # x # (self # xs)
  PNil -> match_nil
```
It turns out that `pelimList` usages *almost always* use a one-off Haskell level function with a redundant `plam` - so `pelimList` would benefit greatly from just taking a Haskell level function directly.

However, **not all higher order functions** benefit from taking Haskell level functions. In many HOF usages, you could benefit from passing a commonly used function argument, rather than a one-off function argument. Imagine `map`, you don't always map with one-off functions - often, you `map` with existing, commonly used functions. In these cases, that commonly used function ought to be a Plutarch level function, so it can be hoisted and `map` can simply reference it.

## Hoisting is great - but not a silver bullet

Hoisting is only beneficial for sufficiently large terms. Hoisting a builtin function, for example - is not very useful-

```haskell
import Plutarch
import qualified PlutusCore as PLC

phoistAcyclic $ punsafeBuiltin PLC.UnListData
```

The term will be the same size anyway. However, if you had a larger term due to, say, using `pforce` -

```haskell
phoistAcyclic $ pforce $ punsafeBuiltin PLC.UnListData
```

Here, hoisting may be beneficial.

You don't need to hoist the top level Plutarch function that you would just pass to `compile`.

## The difference between `PlutusType`/`PCon` and `PLift`'s `pconstant`
`PlutusType` is especially useful for building up Plutarch terms *dynamically* - i.e, from arbitrary Plutarch terms. This is when your Plutarch type's constructors contain other Plutarch terms.

Another case `PlutusType` is useful is when you want to give your Plutarch type a custom representation, scott encoding, enum - what have you. From the `PlutusType` haddock example-
```hs
data AB = A | B

instance PlutusType AB where
  type PInner AB _ = PInteger
  pcon' A = 0
  pcon' B = 1
  pmatch' x f = pif (x #== 0) (f A) (f B)
```
You can use the `A` and `B` constructors during building, but still have your type be represented as integers under the hood! You cannot do this with `pconstant`.

You should prefer `pconstant` (from [`PConstant`/`PLift`](#pconstant--plift)) when you can build something up entirely from Haskell level constants and that *something* has the same representation as the Haskell constant.

## List iteration is strict
Chained list operations (e.g a filter followed by a map) are not very efficient in Plutus Core. In fact, the iteration is not lazy at all! For example, if you did a `pfilter`, followed by a `pmap`, on a builtin list - the entire `pmap` operation would be computed first, the whole list would be iterated through, and *only then* the `pfilter` would start computing. Ridiculous!

## Let Haskell level functions take responsibility of evaluation
We've discussed how a Haskell level function that operates on Plutarch level terms needs to [be careful](#dont-duplicate-work) about [work duplication](#plet-to-avoid-work-duplication). Related to this point, it's good practice to design your Haskell level functions so that *it takes responsibility* for evaluation.

The user of your Haskell level function doesn't know how many times it uses the argument it has been passed! If it uses the argument multiple times without `plet`ing it - there's duplicate work! There's 2 solutions to this-
* The user `plet`s the argument before passing it to the Haskell level function.
* The Haskell level function takes responsibility of its argument and `plet`s it itself.

The former is problematic since it's based on *assumption*. What if the Haskell level function is a good rule follower, and correctly `plet`s its argument if using it multiple times? Well, then there's a `plet` by the caller *and* the callee. It won't evaluate the computation twice, so that's good! But it does increase the execution units and the script size a bit!

Instead, try to offload the responsbility of evaluation to the Haskell level function - so that it only `plet`s when it needs to.

Of course, this is not applicable for recursive Haskell level functions!

## The isomorphism between `makeIsDataIndexed`, Haskell ADTs, and `PIsDataRepr`
When [implementing `PIsDataRepr`](#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends) for a Plutarch type, if the Plutarch type also has a Haskell synonym (e.g `ScriptContext` is the haskell synonym to `PScriptContext`) that uses [`makeIsDataIndexed`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx.html#v:makeIsDataIndexed) - you must make sure the constructor ordering is correct.

> Aside: What's a "Haskell synonym"? It's simply the Haskell type that *is supposed to* correspond to a Plutarch type. There doesn't *necessarily* have to be some sort of concrete connection (though there can be, using [`PLift`/`PConstant`](#pconstant--plift)) - it's merely a connection you can establish mentally.
>
> This detail does come into play in concrete use cases though. After compiling your Plutarch code to a `Script`, when you pass Haskell data types as arguments to the `Script` - they obviously need to correspond to the actual arguments of the Plutarch code. For example, if the Plutarch code is a function taking `PScriptContext`, after compilation to `Script`, you *should* pass in the Haskell data type that actually shares the same representation as `PScriptContext` - the "Haskell synonym", so to speak. In this case, that's `ScriptContext`.

In particular, with `makeIsDataIndexed`, you can assign *indices* to your Haskell ADT's constructors. This determines how the ADT will be represented in Plutus Core. It's important to ensure that the corresponding Plutarch type *knows* about these indices so it can decode the ADT correctly - in case you passed it into Plutarch code, through Haskell.

For example, consider `Maybe`. Plutus assigns these indices to its constructors-
```hs
makeIsDataIndexed ''Maybe [('Just, 0), ('Nothing, 1)]
```
0 to `Just`, 1 to `Nothing`. So the corresponding Plutarch type, `PMaybeData` is defined as-
```hs
data PMaybeData a (s :: S)
  = PDJust (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= a]))
  | PDNothing (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
```
It'd be a very subtle mistake to instead define it as-
```hs
data PMaybeData a (s :: S)
  = PDNothing (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
  | PDJust (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= a]))
```
The constructor ordering is wrong!

It's not just constructor ordering that matters - field ordering does too! Though this is self explanatory. Notice how `PTxInfo` shares the exact same field ordering as its Haskell synonym - `TxInfo`.
```hs
newtype PTxInfo (s :: S)
  = PTxInfo
      ( Term
          s
          ( PDataRecord
              '[ "inputs" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PTxInInfo)
               , "outputs" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PTxOut)
               , "fee" ':= PValue
               , "mint" ':= PValue
               , "dcert" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PDCert)
               , "wdrl" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData (PTuple PStakingCredential PInteger))
               , "validRange" ':= PPOSIXTimeRange
               , "signatories" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PPubKeyHash)
               , "data" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData (PTuple PDatumHash PDatum))
               , "id" ':= PTxId
               ]
          )
      )
```
```hs
data TxInfo = TxInfo
  { txInfoInputs      :: [TxInInfo]
  , txInfoOutputs     :: [TxOut]
  , txInfoFee         :: Value
  , txInfoMint        :: Value
  , txInfoDCert       :: [DCert]
  , txInfoWdrl        :: [(StakingCredential, Integer)]
  , txInfoValidRange  :: POSIXTimeRange
  , txInfoSignatories :: [PubKeyHash]
  , txInfoData        :: [(DatumHash, Datum)]
  , txInfoId          :: TxId
  }
```
The *field names* don't matter though. They are merely labels that don't exist in runtime.

# Common Issues

## No instance for (PUnsafeLiftDecl a)
You should add `PLift a` to the context! `PLift` is just a synonym to `PUnsafeLiftDecl`.

## Infinite loop / Infinite AST

While maybe not immediately obvious, things like the following are a no-go in Plutarch:

```haskell
f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger)
f = phoistAcyclic $ plam $ \n ->
  pif (n #== 0)
    0
    $ n + f # (n - 1)
```

The issue here is that the AST is infinitely large. Plutarch will try to traverse this AST and will in the process not terminate, as there is no end to it. In this case you'd fix it by using `pfix`.

Relevant issue: [#19](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/issues/19)

## Couldn't match type `Plutarch.DataRepr.Internal.PUnLabel ...` arising from a use of `pfield` (or `hrecField`, or `pletFields`)
You might get some weird errors when using `pfield`/`hrecField`/`pletFields` like the above. Don't be scared! It just means that the type application you used is incorrect. Specifically, the type application names a non-existent field. Re-check the field name string you used in the type application for typos!

## Expected a type, but "fieldName" has kind `GHC.Types.Symbol`
This just means the argument of a type application wasn't correctly promoted. Most likely arising from a usage of `pfield`/`hrecField`/`pletFields`. In the case of `pfield` and `hrecField`, the argument of type application should have kind `Symbol`. A simple string literal representing the field name should work in this case. In the case of `pletFields`, the argument of type application should have kind `[Symbol]` - a type level list of types with kind `Symbol`. When you use a singleton list here, like `["foo"]` - it's actually parsed as a *regular* list (like `[a]`). A regular list, of course, has kind `Type`.

All you need to do, is put a `'` (quote) infront of the list, like so- `@'["foo"]`. This will promote the `[a]` to the type level.

## Lifting `PAsData`
Don't try to lift a `PAsData` term! It's intentionally blocked and partial. The `PLift` instance for `PAsData` is only there to make some important functionality work correctly. But the instance methods will simply error if used. Instead, you should extract the `Term s a` out of `Term s (PAsData a)` using `pfromData` and `plift` that instead!
