# Conditionals

You can simulate `if/then/else` at the Plutarch level using `pif`:

```haskell
pif :: Term s PBool -> Term s a -> Term s a -> Term s a
```

This has similar semantics to Haskell's `if/then/else`. That is, only the branch for which the predicate holds - is evaluated.

```haskell
pif (pconstant True) 1 2
```

The above evaluates to `1`, which has type `Term s PInteger`.
